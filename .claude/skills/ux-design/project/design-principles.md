# Project-Specific Design Principles

**Note**: This file references the main project design principles located at `/Users/ben/Projects/pikaplay/context/design-principles.md`.

## How to Use

When working on this project (PikaPlay), always refer to the project-specific design principles file for:

- Brand-specific rules
- Component patterns
- Color palette
- Typography choices
- Spacing conventions
- Any project-specific UX decisions

## Reading the Project File

Use the Read tool to access the full design principles:

## Integration with UX Skill

The UX Design skill provides **universal best practices** from authoritative sources (Nielsen Norman Group, WCAG, Don Norman, etc.).

The project design principles file provides **project-specific implementations** of those best practices.

**Workflow**:
1. Apply universal UX principles (from this skill's reference files)
2. Check project design principles for project-specific rules
3. Resolve conflicts by prioritizing project guidelines (they're tailored to this specific context)
4. If project guidelines contradict best practices, question it (may be outdated or wrong)

## Project Context

**Project**: PikaPlay
**Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript (frontend), FastAPI (backend)
**Target Users**: Parents of babies aged 6 months to 2 years
