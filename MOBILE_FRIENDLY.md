# Mobile-Friendly Frontend Implementation

Make the entire frontend application responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] **Setup Tailwind CSS Breakpoints:** Configure custom breakpoints in `tailwind.config.js` for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- [x] **Create Responsive Main Layout:** Adapt the main `App.tsx` layout to be responsive.
- [x] **Implement Hamburger Menu:** Create a hamburger menu for mobile navigation that contains the `AccountSelector` and `PortfolioSelector`.
- [x] **`HoldingsTable.tsx`:**
    - [x] On mobile screens, display only 'Type', 'Symbol', 'Price', and 'Total Value' columns.
    - [x] Implement a way to view the hidden columns, perhaps by tapping a row to expand it.
- [x] **`PortfolioSummary.tsx`:** Adjust summary cards to stack vertically on smaller screens.
- [x] **`PieChart.tsx`:** Ensure the pie chart resizes and remains legible on mobile devices.
- [x] **`HoldingsHeatmap.tsx`:** Ensure the heatmap is responsive and interactive on smaller screens.
- [x] **`Login.tsx`:** Make the login page and form responsive.
- [x] **AI Chat Components (`AIAnalyst.tsx`, `AIChat.tsx`):** Ensure the chat interface, messages, and input fields are mobile-friendly.
- [x] **Address UI Issues from Testing (Round 1):**
    - [x] Hide table filter on mobile to prevent layout issues.
    - [x] Fix chart offset when table is visible.
    - [x] Allow hamburger menu to be closed by clicking the icon again.
    - [x] Fix AI chat panel going out of bounds on mobile.
- [x] **Address UI Issues from Testing (Round 2):**
    - [x] Hide "30d Trend" column from mobile view in holdings table.
    - [x] Fix AI chat panel layout to prevent incorrect overlap on mobile and desktop.
- [x] **Address UI Issues from Testing (Round 3):**
    - [x] Reduce column padding and shorten headers in holdings table on mobile.
    - [x] Hide percentage in total value column on mobile.

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] **Cross-Browser/Device Testing:** Test the application across different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and device emulators for mobile and tablet views.

## Future Tasks

- [ ] **Performance Optimization:** Ensure mobile performance is optimal, especially for data-heavy components.
- [ ] **Final UI/UX Polish:** Review and refine the mobile user experience.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow a phased approach. First, we'll set up the foundational responsive grid and navigation. Then, we will adapt each major component to be mobile-friendly. The `HoldingsTable` will be a key focus, adopting a condensed view on mobile as seen on sites like CoinMarketCap. Finally, we'll conduct thorough testing to ensure a consistent experience across all target devices.
